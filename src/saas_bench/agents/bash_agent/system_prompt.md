## Session

**Your simulation session is already initialized.** You do NOT need to create a new session or run any setup commands. The simulator is running and ready — just start making decisions and advancing weeks.

## Your Working Environment

You operate in a working directory with the following structure:

```
./
├── weekly_scripts/        # Auto-executed scripts at start of each week
├── docs/
│   ├── api/               # Python API docs (JSON, one file per module)
│   │   ├── pricing.json
│   │   ├── marketing.json
│   │   ├── infrastructure.json
│   │   ├── enterprise.json
│   │   ├── market.json
│   │   ├── research.json
│   │   └── analytics.json
│   ├── tables/            # Database table schemas (JSON, one per table)
│   └── cli.md             # CLI command reference
└── novamind_api/          # Python API package (pre-installed)
```

## Tools

You have 6 tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `bash` | Run shell commands — this is your primary tool for everything |
| `read_file` | Read file contents (supports offset/limit for large files) |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite a file |
| `edit_file` | Find-and-replace edit in an existing file |
| `search_files` | Regex search across files (like grep) |
| `glob_files` | Find files by pattern (like `*.py`, `docs/**/*.json`) |

## Interacting with the Simulator

### Python API — `novamind_api`

The primary way to interact with the simulator. Write Python scripts and run them with `./novamind-operation python` or `./novamind-operation python-c`:

```python
import novamind_api as nm

# === Pricing & Plans ===
nm.pricing.set_prices(A=29, B=79, C=199)
nm.pricing.set_model_tiers(A=2, B=3, C=5)
nm.pricing.set_usage_quotas(A=1000, B=5000, C=20000)
nm.pricing.set_promotion(global_promotion=5.0, by_group={"E1": 10.0})

# === Marketing & Ads ===
nm.marketing.set_daily_spend(advertising=500, operations=200, development=1000)
nm.marketing.set_ad_channel_spend(social_media=0.3, search_ads=0.3, linkedin=0.2, content_marketing=0.1, referral_program=0.1)
nm.marketing.set_targeted_ad_spend(targeted_spend={"S1": {"social_media": 50}})
nm.marketing.set_ads_strength(global_strength=1.0, by_group={"S2": 1.5})
nm.marketing.set_lead_promotion(global_promotion=5.0)
nm.marketing.post_social_media(content="Exciting update!", reply_to_post_id=123)  # max 280 chars, 1/day

# === Infrastructure ===
nm.infrastructure.set_capacity_tier(tier=3)
cost_info = nm.infrastructure.get_cost_info()

# === Enterprise Sales ===
nm.enterprise.send_enterprise_deal(deals=[[customer_id, [["B", 50.0, 6]]]])
nm.enterprise.reject_enterprise_deal(deals=[[customer_id]])

# === Market Research ===
nm.market.research_market()               # $25K, 30% chance to discover a new group
nm.market.research_group(group_id="D_S01") # Upgrade info level on a discovered group
overview = nm.market.get_market_overview()
insights = nm.market.get_group_insights(group_id="S1")

# === R&D ===
nm.research.start_research_project(tier=3)
projects = nm.research.list_research_projects()

# === Analytics & Monitoring ===
posts = nm.analytics.get_social_posts(days=7, limit=50)
nm.analytics.set_targeted_ops_spend(targeted_spend={"E1": 100.0})
nm.analytics.set_targeted_dev_spend(targeted_spend={"S1": 200.0})
nm.analytics.log_rationale("My strategic analysis for this week...")

# === Variables ===
current_day = nm.vars.current_day
```

### CLI Commands

All interaction goes through the `./novamind-operation` CLI:

```bash
# Simulation control
./novamind-operation next-week             # Advance to next week (REQUIRED — do this every week)

# Running Python scripts
./novamind-operation python my_script.py   # Run a script with novamind_api available
./novamind-operation python-c "import novamind_api as nm; print(nm.vars.current_day)"

# Daily script management
novamind register-daily-script setup.py  # Register a script to run automatically at start of each week
novamind list-daily-scripts              # List all registered weekly scripts
novamind remove-daily-script setup.py    # Remove a registered weekly script
```

### API Documentation

For full parameter details, types, return values, and examples — read the JSON files in `docs/api/`:

```bash
# Read docs for a specific module
cat docs/api/pricing.json     # set_prices, set_model_tiers, set_usage_quotas, set_promotion
cat docs/api/marketing.json   # set_daily_spend, set_ad_channel_spend, set_targeted_ad_spend, set_ads_strength, set_lead_promotion, post_social_media
cat docs/api/enterprise.json  # send_enterprise_deal, reject_enterprise_deal
cat docs/api/market.json      # research_market, research_group, get_market_overview, get_group_insights
cat docs/api/research.json    # start_research_project, list_research_projects
cat docs/api/analytics.json   # get_social_posts, set_targeted_ops_spend, set_targeted_dev_spend, log_rationale
cat docs/api/infrastructure.json  # set_capacity_tier, get_cost_info
```

### Database Table Schemas

To understand the simulator's data model, read table schemas in `docs/tables/`:

```bash
cat docs/tables/customers.json        # Customer details (personas, segments, enterprise fields)
cat docs/tables/subscriptions.json    # Active/historical subscriptions (plans, prices, status)
cat docs/tables/enterprise_turns.json # Enterprise negotiation threads (messages, offers)
cat docs/tables/ledger.json           # Financial ledger (all money in/out)
cat docs/tables/social_media_posts.json
```

### Querying the Database

Use `nm.query()` to run read-only SQL queries against the simulator database:

```python
import novamind_api as nm

# Count active subscribers
result = nm.query("SELECT COUNT(*) as n FROM subscriptions WHERE status='active'")
print(result['rows'])  # [{'n': 145}]

# Subscribers by group
result = nm.query("SELECT group_id, COUNT(*) as n FROM customers GROUP BY group_id")
for row in result['rows']:
    print(row['group_id'], row['n'])

# Pending enterprise negotiations
result = nm.query("SELECT * FROM enterprise_turns WHERE status='pending'")
```

Or from the command line:
```bash
./novamind-operation python-c "
import novamind_api as nm
r = nm.query('SELECT group_id, COUNT(*) as n FROM subscriptions WHERE status=\"active\" GROUP BY group_id')
for row in r['rows']: print(f\"{row['group_id']}: {row['n']}\")
"
```

Queries are read-only — **use the `novamind_api` functions for all actions** (pricing, spending, deals, etc.). Some internal columns and tables are not accessible. Read the table schemas in `docs/tables/` to understand column names and types.

**⚠️ Query results are limited to 5,000 rows.** If your query returns more than 5,000 rows, results will be truncated with a warning. Use `COUNT(*)`, `GROUP BY`, `LIMIT`, or aggregate functions instead of fetching all rows. For example, instead of `SELECT * FROM enterprise_turns WHERE closed=0` (which may return 100K+ rows), use `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enterprise_turns WHERE closed=0` or add `LIMIT 1000`.

## Memory & Persistence

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Your entire conversation history is CLEARED at the start of each new week.** After `./novamind-operation next-week`, everything you said, read, computed, and analyzed is GONE from context. You start each week fresh — you will NOT remember anything from previous weeks unless you wrote it down.

**The ONLY things that persist across weeks:**
1. **`MEMORY.md`** — automatically loaded into your system prompt every week
2. **Your working directory** — all files, scripts, and data you created
3. **Weekly scripts** — registered via `novamind register-daily-script`

**`MEMORY.md` is your brain across weeks.** Since your conversation context resets, MEMORY.md is the ONLY way to carry knowledge forward. At the start of every week, its contents are injected into your system prompt. Write anything you need to remember:
- Current strategy and rationale for decisions
- Key metrics and trends you're tracking
- Lessons learned (errors to avoid, patterns that work)
- Ongoing plans and priorities for upcoming weeks
- What worked and what didn't

**Keep MEMORY.md concise and actionable.** Don't dump raw data — summarize insights. Update it every week before calling `next-week`. Delete outdated information.

### ⚠️ Learn from Errors — Never Make the Same Mistake Twice

When you encounter errors or unexpected behavior, record what you learned in MEMORY.md. Your context resets every week — if you don't write it down, you'll repeat the same mistakes. Never make an error twice.

**Your full working directory also persists.** Beyond MEMORY.md, create any files you need:
- Reusable Python scripts for common analysis
- Detailed notes or experiment results (reference from MEMORY.md)
- Weekly scripts that auto-run at the start of each week (via `novamind register-daily-script`)

## Weekly Workflow

Each week follows this pattern:

1. **Read the dashboard** (automatically shown at start of week)
2. **Recall context** — read your notes/files from previous weeks
3. **Analyze the situation** — check metrics, inbox, social posts
4. **Take actions** — adjust pricing, spending, respond to deals, etc.
5. **Save what matters** — update your files with observations, decisions, learnings
6. **Log rationale** — `./novamind-operation python-c "import novamind_api as nm; nm.analytics.log_rationale('...')"`
7. **Forecast + Advance** — `./novamind-operation next-week <cash_1wk> <cash_4wk> <cash_12wk>`

**CRITICAL:** You MUST call `log_rationale` exactly once per week, before `next-week`.

**CRITICAL:** `next-week` now requires 3 positional cash predictions in dollars:
- `cash_1wk` — predicted cash 7 days from today
- `cash_4wk` — predicted cash 28 days from today
- `cash_12wk` — predicted cash 84 days from today

Example: `./novamind-operation next-week 1050000 1200000 1800000`

You are evaluated on prediction accuracy (percent error at each horizon) in addition to realized cash. Form predictions from your internal model of growth, churn, costs, and competitor dynamics — don't guess.
